# FROI-PPC-Project-


## 🔥 Usage

What is it ? 

This project is designed to assist in solving exams questions for the course "Fonctions et Réactions Organiques I," taught by Professor Jieping Zhu. It specifically addresses questions related to both reversible and irreversible carbonyl reactions.

How It Works? 

Upon receiving input in the form of starting materials (i.e., specific molecules and their associated conditions), the application utilizes a pre-defined database of organic reactions to identify the applicable chemical reaction. It then computes and returns the resulting compound, effectively simulating the expected exam response.

Why ? 

 It simplifies identifying reaction pathways and predicting products, thus enhancing study efficiency and accuracy for students preparing their FROI exam.
